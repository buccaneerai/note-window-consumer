      text: "Hi. Hi, my name is Aspen Fieldscout. I'm Dr. Briar Hayfield. How can I help you? I've got this crazy bad headache. Okay, can you tell me a little bit more about it? Well, it just woke up with me and it's been like this since about five. And it's just been like terrible since. Okay, where does it hurt? Right here. Sorry. Were you feeling fine when you went to bed last night? Well, I sort of felt actually kind of feverish. My son has actually been sick for a couple of days and I thought, I said to my wife, I think I'm getting what, what Liam's got. And so I sort of felt like I'm getting sick, like maybe nauseated, but that is that that's it. Okay, with this headache, are you having any other symptoms? Like are you getting blurred vision or anything like that or numbness or weakness? No, but I, the only thing is like the pain was just so bad. I was just throwing up with the pain. It was crazy like it still is. It's just so bad, right? You look pretty uncomfortable. I'm going to get my nurse to put in an IV and give you something for the pain. Is that okay? Okay. Heavy grace. Okay. A little bit more about this headache. Did you ever get headaches? Do you have problems with headaches? No, no. Do you have any other medical problems? I've got some asthma and oh, I got, I've got like some car sickness, but I've been told once before that's like, there's a large history of family of migraines in my family that might be connected. My asthma has been pretty bad, pretty stable. Do you take any medications? Yeah, I'm on an orange puffer. I take all the time. I think it's flow vent or float is seen or something like that. I've got the blue puffer, but I almost never have to take it. Do you have any allergies? No, not at all. Okay. Now tell me about your kids a bit sick right now, but you woke up with a sudden onset of a headache. Is that correct? Yeah, I woke up and it was just there. It's, it's, it woke me up. It's just crazy. It's just the worst pain I've ever had. Oh yeah. Did you try anything for that pain? Yeah, I took some Tylenol. I had a couple extra strength tablets and that made no difference. Okay. Few other questions. Have you had any rash, diarrhea, swollen joints or anything else? No, but my son had a bit of a rash there, right? But I'm sure. Have you recently traveled outside of the country? No. Okay. So we're going to get you something for the pain and I'll need to examine you. Okay. I'm going to a brief physical exam. Is that okay? Okay. Okay. Great. First off, I'm just going to feel your neck. Okay. And now let's have you lay down and lay still. Does that hurt? It does. Where exactly does it hurt? All over. Okay. That morphine is going to come fairly shortly. Okay. Okay. All right. I'm going to lift your legs and just tell me if this hurts at all. Does it hurt in your leg or neck or anything like that? A little bit now. Does this hurt at all? Not really. Okay. I have to look at a couple of other things. I'm going to examine your eyes. Is the light bothering your eyes at all? No, not really. Okay. Just look straight up at the ceiling for me. Does that bother your eyes at all? Not really. Okay. Have you ever had morphine before? No. All right. We're also going to give you something for that nausea as well. Okay. Okay. Are you feeling sick to your stomach at all right now? A little bit. I think it's just the pain. Okay. I got to look at a couple of nerves. Okay. Okay. It might be easier for you to sit up. Can you sit up for me? Sure. Are you going to be okay? Yeah, I think. All right. Just follow my fingers with your eyes. Okay. Now clench your teeth real tight for me. Good. Now close your eyes real tight. Good. Now show me your teeth. Good. Can you wrinkle up your forehead or look at the ceiling? Great. Can you hear this at all? Can you hear it on the side? Yeah. What about this side? Yeah. Open your mouth for me and say, ah. Ah. Push your head against my hand. That's really sore. Okay. Well, we'll leave that for now. Can you shrug your shoulders? Okay. Good. Can you stick your tongue out at me? Good. I'm just about done examining you, but I have to do a few other things. We're going to check your reflexes. Have you ever had that done before? Years ago. All right. Well, let's just see if you have good reflexes. Okay. All right. This one, you've got good reflexes. That's a good sign. That's good. Okay. Just relax. Push your arms up like this for me. Keep them down. Good. Now push against my hands. Good. Now relax your arms. Okay. Okay. Don't let me turn this one and don't let me turn this other one. Okay. Give me the biceps here. Good. Now this one. Good. Now put your fingers out like this. Good. Now squeeze my fingers. Great. Now push against my hand. Good. Now push against this hand. Okay. Just relax. Great. Sorry to push you through that. Just lay down and try and get comfortable and we'll get you a blanket. So I'm a little bit worried about you. I'm worried about a couple of things. Okay. I'm worried about the chance of you having meningitis. Okay. Now this is a bit of a scary term. You also tell me this is the worst headache of your life. Oh yeah. So there's a small chance there's something else going on, like a small bleed in your brain. So those are both very scary, potentially dangerous things. Okay. So we're going to give you something for the pain and we're going to send you off for a CAT scan of your brain to make sure there's no blood or anything else in there. Okay. If that's normal, I will have to do a lumbar puncture. I have to take some fluid from your spine. Okay. Whatever. Okay."

      text: "Hi Brian. How are you doing today? I’m doing fine, Dr. Mollon. I followed up with the cardiologist like you recommended. Thanks Brian. I’m glad to hear that. Last time you were here about six weeks ago, we talked about the heart rates you saw on your smart watch going up to 200. I’m glad that you were able to see the cardiologist as I recommended. I received the evaluation from cardiology, which ordered the 24 hour Holter monitor and I saw that that study was completed. Thanks for going through all of that. Hopefully it was relatively straightforward and not any problem for you. I don’t know if the cardiologist talked to you about the results, but there were no abnormal readings. Both the cardiologist and I agree that we do not need any additional workup or testing or evaluation for the heart rates you saw in your smart watch. If you do have any symptoms that accompany the heart rates that are high on the smart watch, definitely let me know right away. Otherwise, we can continue to monitor as needed. Thanks, doc. The cardiologist told me the same story and I’m glad that all of this is resolved. I do like the smart watch and use it routinely for exercise and walking and everything, so I’ll continue to do that and I’ll let you know if I have any symptoms or anything and if I see any patterns with the smart watch and the heart rate, I can let you know. But I’m glad everything turned out okay with the testing. That’s great. Do you have any other questions about the heart rate or the smart watch or the Holter monitor testing? No, everything seems fine. I understand everything and appreciate your help with going through the questions I had. No problem Brian. Glad to help out and glad to see that all of the study results are negative and we don’t really need to do anything further. That sounds great to me. We also talked about your hemoglobin last time and over the last six months looked like there was a gradual decrease in the hemoglobin. That may have been a pattern, so I did recommend that colonoscopy. Just wanna make sure that there’s no blood loss occurring in the gastrointestinal tract. Dr. Mollon. I have not had a chance to see the gastroenterologist yet, but I will definitely talk to my son who’s a doctor and decide if you know I wanna see the gastroenterologist and the colonoscopy and where the best place is to go and everything. That’ll be fine. I recommend the colonoscopy, so please let your son know that he can talk to me if he has any questions or would like to discuss your case. Yeah, I’ll do that. Okay, thanks. Otherwise, don’t really need to do anything further with the hemoglobin. We’ll keep on monitoring every three months with blood tests. Thanks. That sounds good. We’re continuing you on the two medications, the Metformin for the pre-diabetes and the Atorvastatin for your cholesterol. Just to review, I saw that you did have the past surgical history of the inguinal repairs and nothing to do there and just wanted to see how you’re doing at home. Yeah, I’m enjoying retirement with my wife and in our house. My son does live nearby. I see him often. He’s a doctor, so I always ask him questions as you know and make sure that everything is good with him. Still not drinking, no alcohol, no smoking, don’t do any other drugs. Great. I just wanted to run through a few other questions to make sure there’s nothing else going on. Sure, that sounds fine. Are you having any headaches or eye symptoms or hearing symptoms? No, nothing at all. Do you have any difficulty breathing or wheezing? No. Are you having any chest pain? Feeling like your heart’s jump or having pain in your legs while walking? No. Do you have any nausea or vomiting, constipation or diarrhea? No, nothing like that. Here’s what we’ll do. We’ll have you continue your metformin for the pre-diabetes. Continue to check the fasting blood sugar every three months. Also, continue the atorvastatin for your cholesterol. In terms of the cardiology evaluation, there’s nothing else to do right now. We’ll just have you follow up with the cardiologist as he recommended once a year. Definitely let me know if there are any symptoms or other concerns with the heart rate or the smart watch in terms of the hemoglobin. Did want you to consider that colonoscopy. Just lemme know if you have any questions and then in terms of following up with me, we’ll just continue every three months. Please get the blood tests for your blood count, the hemoglobin, as well as the lipids, the cholesterol, and your fasting glucose every three months and then we will follow up as needed. Thanks so much for everything, doc. I appreciate your help and I will see you next time. Thanks so much, Brian. Take care."

      text: "Hi August Clancy, how are you doing today? Not so good, doctor. Actually, we're starting a new system here. Would you mind just telling me your first and last name, please? Yeah, Aspen Fieldscout. Alright, and can you also just confirm your date of birth, please? August 18, 1988. Okay, thanks for that. So, tell me, what's going on? Well, I've had a cough for about two weeks now and I just can't seem to get rid of it. Did it start two weeks ago? Well, it kind of started about three weeks ago. Okay. But it's been really bad for the last two weeks. Okay, and over the last two weeks, has it been about the same? Is it getting better, getting worse from the beginning to now? I'd say it's been about the same. It's been about the same. And when it started three weeks ago, was there anything going on that might have started the cough for you? Well, yeah, I started with cold. I had all kinds of gunk in my throat and it was causing me to cough. Okay. But I feel like I got over the cold, but the cough just hasn't gone away. So, what were the other cold symptoms that you had when it started three weeks ago? Well, I had a bit of a fever and a lot of nasal congestion. I felt like my senses were kind of really clogged up. Okay. And so those symptoms have all subsided, but you still have the cough. Is that right? Yeah, I've just been coughing, but it hasn't really been productive. Like I'm not coughing anything up. Okay. So, just a dry cough then? Yeah, just a dry cough. Okay. And over the last few weeks, you said it's been about the same. So, about like, you know, how often are you coughing in a given day? No, it seems to come and go. It seems to be worse when I exercise or like if I'm outside, cold air. Okay. So, cold air makes it worse or more frequent. Exercise makes it worse or more frequent. Is that right? Yeah. I should mention my other doctor thought that I might have asthma. Okay. And have you ever been diagnosed or treated for asthma? I'm not sure if I was officially diagnosed, but they did give me an inhaler. I think it was a flow vent or something like that. Okay. And when's the last time you used that for any asthma-like symptoms? Oh, I haven't used it in months. Okay. So, you haven't done it in the last few weeks or last two or three weeks when you had this cough recently? No. I don't have a prescription for it anymore. Okay. And you don't have any in your home. You don't have any of the inhalers left? No. Okay. That's fine. That could be an option. Tell me if you have any other, you know, associated symptoms with the coughing. Not the cold symptoms, but like in the last week or two, since the cold symptoms mostly subsided, you had any other symptoms associated with the cough? Yeah. Sometimes I feel like a little bit wheezing, and my chest just feels kind of like tight, like inflamed. Okay. Is it painful in your chest? Not painful, just like a little bit of discomfort, I would say. Okay. Can you tell if it's one side of the chest or the other or kind of throughout? I think it's just throughout. Okay. So it's not left or right, just kind of throughout? Yeah. I'd say it's pretty evenly. Okay. Are you having any headaches at all? No. I don't recall having any headaches recently. Any changes in your vision? No. No changes. No blurry vision, double vision, anything like that? No. Nothing like that. And you said before during the cold, three weeks ago, the kind of the nasal congestion, runny nose, and anything like that in the last one or two days or last week? I have noticed a little bit of drip on the back of my throat. Okay. And then any sore throat at all? Again, not the cold part of it, but in the last few days or last week? No, no sore throat. Okay. All right. Any difficulty breathing or shortness of breath? Sometimes I feel a little bit short of breath, especially if I'm exercising or moving around. Okay. And does it feel like you're drowning when you're underwater and you just can't breathe? There's almost like water in your lungs? No. No. Okay. How about any nausea or vomiting? One time I did cough so hard that I vomited a little bit. Okay. But right after the cough? Yeah. Okay. Any nausea otherwise or vomiting otherwise when it's not like right after the cough? No. Okay. What about constipation, diarrhea? No. I haven't noticed anything like that. Okay. Any pain anywhere else in your body, arms, legs, back? No, I don't think so. Okay. And then any changes in sensation like touching things with your hands or kind of feeling the ground on your feet, anything like that? No. No. Okay. All right. So I think what I'd like to do is take a look at your throat and your nose and see if there's anything abnormal that I can see. And then we'll do just a rapid flu test and a rapid COVID test just to rule those out, make sure that there's nothing residual going on from that. But most likely, this sounds like maybe related to a history of asthma or asthma-like condition or maybe even allergies and then a residual cough that sometimes occurs after upper respiratory infection like a cold. And so most likely it is residual cough post URI is what we would call it. And we can try a couple things. I do want to do those lab tests like I mentioned. I'll get you a prescription for Tessalon pearls, which could be helpful reducing the cough. But at first, and then I can also put down just a few over-the-counter medications that might be helpful, like a robotessa or a generic of a robotessa that has dextromethorphan. That'll be a cough suppressant that could help you out as well. And then, you know, I'd suggest we try these for maybe like a week or two, see how it goes. And I think just naturally it will probably recover from this residual cough, just symptomatically like the Tessalon pearls and the cough syrup with the dextromethorphan should help. Okay. Great. Well, thank you, doctor. I really appreciate the help. All right. Thanks for coming in. I think you'll be back to normal soon. Thanks, doctor Briar Hayfield All right."

I have a really bad sore throat. It's been going on for about five days now. OK. And on a scale of 1 to 10, how bad would you say your throat pain is?  I would say it's about an eight. Okay. And do you any other symptoms besides your throat pain? Yeah, when it started I felt a little feverish.  Like I had some and I felt like I was running hot Did you record your temperature at home? No We exposed anybody else that had anything that you...  No. Yeah, right before this started, my son was sick too. He also had a sore throat and was running a fever. Okay, did you take him to the doctor? Do you know where he got it? Yeah, we took him. They said that he had throat. Oh, okay.  Did you try to help your sore throat to make it better? Yeah, I took some ibuprofen and that helped. And do you have any past medical history John? Like diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, any chronic conditions? Yeah, I've had asthma for about 10 years now. Do you take any medicines on an everyday I take Flovent to control my asthma. What's all? Allergic to any medicines that you know?  Yeah, I'm allergic to C-chlor.  Okay. Do you smoke cigarettes? No. Drink No. You don't drive it off? Uh... Yeah, I have a history of cocaine abuse. Okay.  or just in the past? No, about 10 years ago. Okay. And... Oh shoot. That might have it up. Watch that in the future. And have you had any surgeries before in your life?  No, only on my wisdom teeth to have those removed. Okay. And are you able to swallow liquids okay? Swallow own saliva? Yeah, it kind of hurts, but I can.  well we're gonna, I'm gonna examine you here first, so listen to your heart and lungs, look in your throat, and then we're gonna order a...  Strap throat swab for you and We get the results back of that I'll come back here and let you know that someone will come in the room in a minute to do your straps  for it. Okay, sounds good. Thank you doctor. All right, so your strep throat test was positive, so that's caused by a bacteria called group A streptococcus. It's probably from what your son may have had as well, so that requires antibiotics. So going to recommend an antibiotic for you to call them boxicillin. What happened when you took C-chloric? What kind of allergy?  Yeah, I'm not really sure I was an infant when it happened. Well, a small likelihood that people that are there See Clark to be allergic to a much than we were taking a moxist on before yeah  have. Okay so we're give you that it'll be one pill twice a day for ten days. I also want you to drink lots of fluids, get plenty of rest.  Tylenol or ibuprofen to help with the pain. And if you're still not better in three to four days, please let us know or your primary care physician. If you're getting worse between now and then, such as a higher fever, vomiting, you can't swallow your own saliva, can't breathe good, those are things we want you to come back and immediately for.

      text: "All right, so can you tell me your first and last name please?  Brook Canterburry. Okay, great. Can you also just confirm your date of birth please? June 3rd, 1989. Okay, great. And so what brings you in today? Yeah, so about, I mean, I've kind of always had back problems, but maybe about two years ago, I started noticing that when I'm sitting down for long periods of time, I've been getting these kind of pains down my left leg, sort of, you know, pit scadles, sort of cold. And I do notice that it seems to be when I'm sitting on like harder surfaces, like hard, like chair, like wood chair, that kind of stuff. It seems to somewhat get better when I exercise. So like when I stretch or do yoga, it seems like it does better. But if I don't do that for a while, it seems to act up. Okay, and you said it started about two years ago? Yeah, I mean, I sort of had some back problems like this, you know, since I was a teenager. But, you know, two years ago, I started going to the gym. I didn't really go to the gym growing up for, you know, younger adult years. But then I started going and one seems to be related to, you know, after I started actually moving again, that it seems to be getting worse. Okay, and you said you were describing on your left leg where you feel that kind of pins and needles and that coldness. Now, are there symptoms in the back itself and the leg, or is it really just the leg where you feel those things? It seems like all of my problems, I forgot what it's called, but that little bone on the back where your hip is, it kind of like sticks out a little bit. It seems like my, you know, QL, my TFL, even my psoas, like all these muscles are just constantly really tight on the left side of my body only, not on the right side. I have had a chiropractor and I had an x-ray before of my lower back. And I was told I'm not a little fuzzy on these, but like L5 or L4, one of the vertebrae is like fused a bit on my left hand side to my hip. And I think that causes some issues like inbound. Yeah, yeah, it's like fused on the left hand side. So my right hand side is always perfectly fine. My left hand side, the muscles are always super tight, like the erector, spinae muscles, and glute muscles, all that kind of stuff. I don't know if it's, they're all locked up and they need to relax somehow but can't or whatever. Yeah, and so around two years ago, that coincided when you started going to the gym and doing more activity. And then that's when you kind of noticed this come on more. And like over the last two years, would you say it's kind of progressively gotten worse, gotten better, about the same, kind of up and down, but never really consistently could get worse? How would you describe it? Yeah, I would say it's getting worse. It's getting worse, okay. Yeah, yeah. So I did the x-ray about six months ago. I was seeing a chiropractor at the time. She suggested I put a lift in my shoe. I tried that for a while. I don't know if that made it better or worse. But yeah, I just, it's at the point now where it kind of keeps me from doing things that I enjoy. It's kind of always, you know, I also look back, I think, sitting down for a long period of time is hard. So I tried to do one. Go ahead. Sorry, go ahead. You're going to say it's interfering with things you enjoy. What are the kinds of physical activities that it's interfering with that you would enjoy? So one, it doesn't ever seem to act up when I'm doing the physical activities, but if it is in an acted up state from being sitting down for too long, it pretty much consumes my mental, you know, like this constant pain and discomfort that kind of detracts from the overall enjoyment of anything else. I see. So it's not during, you know, whatever enjoyable activities that you have that happen. It's just, it's kind of like a baseline when you're sitting too long that prevents you or precludes you from doing the other stuff. Is that right? Right. I do, I will say using like a ball, like a, you know, like a lacrosse ball and kind of putting pressure on various things like my QL or in the blue does seem to provide some relief. But I'm not sure if it just provides temporary relief and causes it to get worse, like causes it to be more inflamed or more aggravated, or if it actually does provide kind of longer term benefits. Sure. And you mentioned the chiropractor, you know, no issue with the lift. Were there any manipulations, spinal manipulations that were done? Tell me a little bit about that. Yeah, I don't know the names of all of them, but a lot of it is, you know, lay down, face down on the table, lift my legs. If I feel any discomfort, you'll, you know, kind of push slightly, kind of near where the hip is or the lower back. Kind of some of those things. She'll have my arm out and then have me like try and resist pressure and then while she's feeling up my curbreeze, try and see if they're out of alignment. She doesn't have to do alignment. I've been seeing this particular chiropractor for like 10 years. Okay. Okay. It sounds like relatively small manipulations, not kind of like a back-cracking kind of manipulation. Okay. All right. No. Okay. And then other than kind of sort of like using a hard lacrosse ball and kind of pressing it, anything else that makes it better, like, you know, like massage or it can over the counter as a tylenol or ibuprofen or anything else that helps it? Yeah, I think non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs do seem to help. I think ice makes the sensation go away quite a bit. I think it's not as much a cold does seem to make it feel better. I mean, really, stretching does make it feel better at the time. So I don't know. But again, I guess I'm still a little unsure. I'm trying to figure out if I'm making it worse by doing those things. I just need to leave it alone and let it just relax somehow. But at the same time, I feel like if I'm not stretching the muscles, then they're not going to relax. They're not going to get better. Okay. And then in terms of at the gym, what kind of workout are you doing? What kind of like are you using machines, weights, cardio, like what kind of your typical workout or if there's not a typical like what are the things that you generally do? When I first started going to the gym, I was doing a lot of cardio. I was doing one of those heart rate based interval training systems. There was a lot of running or rowing, a lot of calisthenics, that kind of thing. Nowadays, I'm doing more just like weight training type stuff. I do use some machines like linear leg press, hip abduction, hip abduction. I'm trying to work those muscles, like those side glute muscles. And when I first started doing that, I did notice that there was a huge discrepancy with the abduction and the adduction with how much of weight I could do. Adduction was just squeezing it in. I could only do like 40 pounds or something on the machine. And over the last couple of years, I'm all the way up to like 150 pounds now. So like pretty marked in the strength of those like leg muscles. Yeah. But yeah, I think I am coming around the idea that maybe there's something about that. And with my lower vertebrae, that's like causing like a pinched nerve or something. I guess that's my concern. Yeah. And some of the symptoms that you mentioned in your leg that sounds nerve-related. So it could be. Now, on like a daily basis or a weekly basis, how often is this bothering you? It's almost daily at this point. Almost so. I would say if I sit down for longer than 10 minutes, I will start to have those sensations. And this is kind of a weird. This is kind of a weird. This is kind of a weird. And if I sit down for too long, I end up with prostatitis. Right? So the inflammation of the prostate. So it really is something to do. To me, it's 100%. There's something mechanical. Right? There's like, it's like I do a lot of Googling. So, you know, WebMD, figure out what's wrong. But like people who ride bikes a lot. It's going to happen too. And so I don't know if there's like some treatment for this or if there's some diagnostic we can do to kind of rule out what the problem is or see if it's nerve-related or see if it's, you know, see what the issue is. Yeah. I mean, I think you're right that there's some nerve involvement because sometimes on your leg, your left leg. And then, you know, I also agree that there's some kind of physical mechanical component to it. So we can certainly explore both of those. Now, have you tried any physical therapy at all? I have done physical therapy. I did 10 sessions. They weren't specifically a hip clinic, right? They weren't specifically a hip place. But they did various things. They, you know, did like deep myofascial release and kind of deep tissue type stuff around my psoas muscle and stuff like that. They even did some dry needling, which I thought was kind of interesting, you know, where they put the needle and then shock it, shock your muscle a little bit. Again, it didn't really seem to help at all. And I did 10 sessions over the course of a month and a half, two months, something like that. And I didn't notice any change. And this was a physical therapist, a PT that was working with you? Yes. Was there any occupational therapists involved? I don't think so. I don't know how I would differentiate. Yeah, there's slightly different skill sets and training, but certainly overlap. And then have you, have you sit a lot for, you know, work or kind of daily activities? Is that something that's typical for you? Yeah. I'm a software engineer, so I spend most of my day sitting down. I do have the option for a standing desk. My desk does convert. But I think standing in the same place kind of does yield the same, what was the same issue. I'll tend to shift my weight to one side or the other. And I think doing that, I can also aggravate it as well. But sitting does seem to be the primary trigger. And are you sitting a lot outside of work time as well? Laying down mostly on the couch. I'm kind of trying to look at the bottom of the box. In the lane, do you have that same problem? Not really. It depends on how I'm, I mean, there are some positions that I'm laying down and the couch is not comfortable yet. But I've kind of figured a way to sit down on the couch where it doesn't bother me. Okay. And just in terms of the pain level, like zero being no pain, ten being the worst, you know, where is it? You're saying most days you have the pain. Like what's the range of that on a given day? On a given day, it's normally between a two and a five. But it can kind of snowball. Like sitting a lot for one day, the next day maybe it will be like an eight. And then when you use, you mentioned NSAIDs help you and like holding the cross ball or hardball pressure there helps. Like what is it, how much does it help in terms like the numbers? When I'm actively pushing, for example, into my QL, I basically don't feel the pain. I only feel the sensation from pushing in the QL. It's so pitiful, but it's a good kind of pain. Does that make sense? Like it's like a rubber of some kind. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And would you say like, you know, if it's like two to five, it brings it pretty much down to zero? Yeah. And then when I'm not doing it again, it'll come back. It'll come back where it was. Okay. And then what about NSAIDs when you're using that? How much does it come down? 30% of whatever it is. Okay. And is it typically one type? Like do you use an ibuprofen slash Advil or is it a different one? Is it Advil or Aleve? Naproxen? Yeah, naproxen is Aleve. So that's a different one than the ibuprofen and advil. So is that typically what you use in a procsen? Yeah. Okay. All right. And do you know, you know, how much you would take to get that, you know, 30% release? I think it's 500 milligrams twice a day. Okay. So you take it, you know, multiple days in a row or do you kind of just take it as needed when the pain is higher? I think it's generally kind of as needed, but I think, you know, yeah. And my only concern with that is just that long term. I know that it's not great for your kidneys or something. So I was kind of taking it as needed. But, you know, from what I did consult with a pharmacist, it's okay to take daily for a few weeks or however long to try and wrangle it in. Yeah, I mean, yeah, that's generally correct. You're right about the kidney issue, but it depends on other factors as well. And so maybe you can tell me about just, and August Clancy, if you want to make some of this fictitious, so can you tell me a little bit about, you know, any medical conditions that you have in general? I don't have any other medical conditions as far as I know. No issues with heart, high blood pressure, diabetes, high blood sugar, something like that. Anything else is pretty much 100% normal. I think just a long history of back problems from all the way from being a teenager and poor posture and being a computer lab. What are any injuries to that area that you're aware of? Like sports or accident, I think. There was, when I was a kid, I slid down a slide head first on my back. And at the bottom of the slide, there was some tree roots. And so I kind of hit the tree roots with my vertebrae. And then I was only like nine. I ended up riding my bike home, which I know is not a great idea after a back injury. Now, now. We went to the hospital, they checked everything out. They said everything was mostly okay, but they said there was some bruising around the vertebrae and stuff. But they ended up sending me home. I wasn't committed to the hospital at all. That's really the only people in the room, x-rays, those kinds of work out. Yeah, right, yeah. When I did do the x-ray for my lower vertebrae there to take a look, they said it's not really possible for them to know if it was due to an injury or if I was just kind of born that way or if it just kind of, you know, so maybe I've always been like this. And, well, maybe that's why I always had back problems on my left side. Because, I mean, my back problems have always been on my left side, even as far back as I can remember. Just in the last two years, it seems to have taken a much different, that's the word, the symptoms have been very different, more acute, more, you know, worse. So any other medications that you take besides the naproxen? Just allergy medication. Aspen Fieldscout, and what do you use for that? Citrazine. Citrazine. And is that the one just over the counter that you use? I do have a prescription for it just because it's cheaper to get a prescription. But, yeah, I think it's just the same as my brand name is. Yeah, and is it like a 10 milligram tab? Yeah, 10 milligram. And you take that daily throughout the year or just during certain times of the year? Summer and fall, I usually don't take it in the wintertime. All right, and then any history of surgeries at all? I've had them. All right, and what about conditions that run in your family, particularly mother, father, or siblings? My mother is very sick. She's always been sick ever since I was a kid. I remember all of them, exactly, but like Briar Hayfield's and fibromyalgia, she also has tons of back problems. She just has back surgery. She's always sick. She's always been sick. So, yeah, maybe there is a genetic component, I'm not sure. And Crohn's. Can you have fibromyalgia Briar Hayfield's for that? Yeah, she's diagnosed, as far as I know, Briar Hayfield's, fibromyalgia, interstitial cystitis. Okay. All kinds of things. And then what about your father or siblings? He is healthy, as far as I know, nothing. My brother had his gallbladder removed, but otherwise healthy. I think that's it, yeah. Okay, and how old are your parents? My dad is 61, and my mom is 58. Okay, and how old are your parents? 58. Okay, and you said you have a brother, any other siblings? I have one full brother, and then three half-siblings. Okay, and then the full brother, how old is he? He's two, though, and me, he is, oh my gosh, 36. 36, okay. All right, and then the half-siblings are those, so you share father or father? Father. Okay. Yep, sure. And how old are they? 26, 24, and 18. Okay, and no medical conditions that you know? I don't think they have any, as far as I know. Anyone else in your family, like on your mom's side, have Crohn's or ulcerative colitis, or any issue with colon? As far as I know, it's just my mother. Just your mother, okay, all right. And did you develop that when I was about two years old? Where to, okay, and do you have an idea of how severe the Crohn's is for your mother? Did she require hospitalizations and surgery, and as she had like colon parts removed? She actually has never had any of it removed, as far as I know. Has she required hospitalizations for the Crohn's, specifically? Many times, yeah. Thank you, all right. And, okay, and so you told me that you're an engineer. Do you use any, or how often do you usually drink, and what do you drink in terms of alcohol? Maybe like once a week, maybe have one or two. Okay. Beer, not hard liquor, beer. One or two, usually beer, once a few times a week, okay. And then maybe twice a week during football. Okay, good. And so what about tobacco use, smoking? Not any tobacco at all, okay. And then any other drug use? No, okay. Good. So then anything else, so you know, we covered your low back issue and kind of your left leg, any other kind of symptoms or things that are bothering today or that typically bother you. And we talked about allergies too, but anything else? It's just that lower left back and left leg, that's pretty much it. Okay. Anything else? All right, and so like in terms of your arms, you know, both arms, no issues at all with those? Okay, all right. And what about like, you know, just partly because your mother has that condition of Crohn's, any problems with, you know, digestion or constipation, those kinds of things? I don't think so, not really. I could pretty much eat whatever I want. I don't really have any issues. Okay, all right. So at this point, if we're in person, probably do, you know, a basic physical exam, you know, focusing in on the area in the lower back and the legs and, you know, test your strength and things. But can't do that over the video chat. So I would, you know, the first thing I would recommend other than the in-person hands-on physical exam would be to reconsider, you know, the physical therapy and occupational therapy. So I think that, you know, you had the trial of physical therapy, and I think maybe adding an occupational therapist and then maybe having some ergonomics or an ergonomist kind of help you with your workstation. That might be helpful for you. I think, you know, they may not solve everything, but I think it can certainly help, particularly the ergonomist, depending on what you've done so far with your workstation, that can definitely add some benefit. And then, you know, the occupational therapist, you know, they're slightly different than a physical therapist, they'd be able to help you in kind of like general posture and things that you do at work, but, you know, also at home, even though they're occupational therapy. So I think, you know, a trial, another trial of PT slash OT and an ergonomist to help you with your workstation can be helpful. And in terms of imaging, I wouldn't suggest anything at the moment. You know, I think that first we want to just try some more conservative approaches. A lot of times you can pick up kind of incidental findings on imaging and chase after them, and that may not be the underlying issue. So we certainly will consider that, but not today. And then in terms of the NSAIDs, so it's good that the NAAP person is, the NAAP person is working for you. So there are a couple of other medications that I think we can try that may be helpful in the same class that are prescription strength. And so, you know, we can do a tortal to start, and that might be helpful. You can also do Tylenol or acetaminophen on a regular basis as opposed to as needed. Sometimes as needed doesn't work that well, but if you take it, what we call standing dose, like, you know, four times a day, 500 milligrams, something like that, that's something that's worth a try, like a trial of a few weeks of that to see if that is something that could work. And so I think I would start with that, with the 500 milligrams of acetaminophen four times a day and do that for two weeks, and then with the as needed, add the prescription tortal. I think that might be a good option for you. And so the thing is, we kind of talked a little bit about, like, heat and ice. So is that something that you've tried, like, a heat pad or, like, ice packs and kind of alternating those? Yeah, I haven't tried both. Okay. I would say ice seems to make it better than heat. He doesn't seem to do a whole lot, but ice seems to provide relief. Okay. So I think that's probably not much more to do there if you've used that. Now, have you tried any kind of patches or creams that kind of numb the area, prescription medicine? Nope, I haven't tried. A couple that might be helpful. There's one called a lidocaine patch, and then there's another one. So that's a patch that you apply, and you can do it, like, you know, 24 hours. So you think it'd be larger, so you cut that down and put it on. And there's also, like, a cream called a capsaicin cream that could be really helpful. And so have you tried that before? Like Badger Bowl? Was that a prescription or an over-the-counter? Was it over-the-counter? Over-the-counter, yeah. So there's the it might be similar, but, like, maybe, so that's another option. But I think in terms of, like, the order, I would start with the, you know, the PTOT evaluation, reevaluation, retraining with the air-conon amnest. We'll all do the prescription of Toradol for as needed. Try the acetaminophen 500 milligrams four times a day, and then add the Toradol as needed. And then we can  maybe next visit, we can see how that works out, and then we can consider, like, the patches or the creams as, you know, a second option. But, yeah, I think that's kind of where we'd start today. Any questions about anything? I don't think so. Yeah, I think looking online, I saw sometimes people recommend, you know, during times of, like, maybe muscle relaxers that target the pelvic muscles. Is that something that you think would be on the treatment plan or  Yeah, that could be an option. I think, you know, I would like to get the opinion of the occupational therapy and physical therapy first on that. You know, like we were talking about, there probably is some nerve involvement. There probably is, you know, some mechanical issue there. But I think sometimes with the right exercises and posture and kind of adjustments from PTOT, you may be able to address that without anything further. But, yeah, muscle relaxants are also an option. I think they may be a little more potent than some of the others I've mentioned. You know, that's certainly an option as well that we can look into."

      text: "Hi, how's it going? Good. How are you doing? Doctor? I'm doing fine. Thanks for coming in today. So, can you just tell me your full name and date of birth for the record, please? Yeah, Briar Hayfield, April 20th, Okay. And what brings you in today? , well, I've been having a really stuffy nose and a lot of, like, post nasal drip. How long has this been going on for? It's been going on for a couple of weeks now? Okay. And is this something new for you? These kind of symptoms? , no, I've had this before, usually happens around, like, springtime sometimes in all. And so over the last few weeks, has it, has it gotten worse? Better stay the same fluctuates how the symptoms been? . I think it's getting worse. Okay. It's been so over the course of a few weeks it's kind of getting worse every day. Or how would you describe that? I'd say gradually getting worse, but probably worse some days than others. Okay. And, any, sick contacts, anyone with like, cold or flu or COVID in the home or at work? No, I don't think so. And when, when you experience the symptoms, does it feel like, you know, when, when you've had, like, allergy symptoms in the past or can you differentiate it all? Sometimes people kind of feel different when they're, you know, sick with flu versus, like, sick with, with allergies. , I don't know, I haven't really noticed a fever or anything like that, so I think maybe it's more allergies and what about, like, time outside or around areas that, you know, you might get allergies from? Yeah, it does seem to be worse if I spend time outdoors. Okay. All right. And is that kind of how, it used to be, like in the past when you've had these kinds of symptoms? Yeah, it seems consistent. Yeah. So, usually, like, outdoor time around this time of year you get these types of symptoms even though when there's no one, like, you know, kind of stick around you. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I mean, I think, like you're suggesting it does sound more like a allergy kind of symptom than, than, something related to, like, upper respiratory infection from, like, a flu or a cold or COVID. And so, have you ever tried anything, any allergy medications to help you with these? , yeah, I've tried Benadryl. That seems to help but it makes me really sleepy. I've tried Claritin and I didn't really find that helped very much. And so have you tried these over the last few weeks or something you just tried in the past? . Yeah, I tried taking Benadryl and that seemed to help when I was taking it. And what what time of day did you try if any specific time of day? Oh, I usually take it before I go to bed at night and in the morning. Okay. Alright. And do you know how many tablets you took? Just one? I think one? Okay and so and they typically come in 25 mg tablets so you just got it from the pharmacy over the counter, right? Yeah. Yeah. so yeah so it sounds like that they haven't really helped too much in the past but but maybe somewhat. Is that fair? Yeah I think they help a little bit little bit. Okay. Is there a couple options in terms of over the counter versus prescription? So we can we can talk about those which which may be helpful for you. So tell me a little bit more about you know the symptoms or anything else you're feeling when you have these symptoms that have been getting worse these past few weeks. I have a little bit of a cough as well so stuffy nose cough. Are you spitting up anything any mucus or flame? Yeah sometimes I cough up like green gunky stuff. Okay. Alright and that's been happening for a few weeks that kinda once in a while. , yeah, it's been especially bad the last couple of weeks and then any difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, a company of that. , no, not really any wheezing sounds when you're breathing. No, no wheezing. Okay. And then what about any, any chest pain or, you know, feeling like your heart is racing? No, nothing like that. I have had a little bit of a sore throat at times two. Okay. But nausea, vomiting. Do you ever feel nauseous with the symptoms? No, no. no vomiting, constipation, diarrhea. No, nothing like that. And then he said no fever. what about like feeling chills or anything like that? No, no. any kind of muscle pain, joint pain soreness. No, I haven't noticed anything like that either. How about like feeling tired, malaise that kind of stuff? Yeah, I have felt a little tired. Okay. Alright. Yeah, that can happen with, with electric symptoms certainly. And then, any other medical issues, any past medical, conditions that, that we haven't talked about or that we've talked about before. No, not that I know. No. Okay. no, diabetes, cholesterol issues. , hypertension, high blood pressure. Okay. Yeah, I think we've done the screening free before, so I haven't picked up on any of those. I just wanted to double check and then in terms of, you know, conditions or diseases that run in the family. any any allergies you know and and your family members, siblings, parents, Children. Yeah, my dad has really bad allergies too but asthma, any family history of asthma, not that I know of. No. Okay. Alright. And then any other conditions that run in the family heart disease, diabetes, lung disease. yeah, my grandmother was diabetic. Okay. All right in terms of your parents, siblings, Children anyone with diabetes? No. Okay. Alright. And then, I think what we'll do is just based on kind of the timing and the symptoms, I think it's worth just quickly checking a rapid test for both flu and, and for COVID. just to rule those out, the tests aren't perfect but if you get a negative on, on both of those, it's much less likely to be any those those two and then, I think, I would like you to try a few different, allergy medications. So I mean if you've done the Benadryl or Claritin, Zyrtec is one that's over the counter saturation is the generic Zyrtec is a brand name us and over the counter medication I would suggest, you know, you can do 10 mg, nightly of that and you know, give it a week and you know, she probably benefit within a day or two, but I would give that a week trial and then we can also do prescription of that. if you have a preference in terms of, kind of like your out of pocket pay. We can, we can start with the prescription of the 10 mg, Zyrtec or if you want to do it over the counter, we can do that. You can let me know and we'll set you up either way and then, I think that's it for now. we'll follow up, you can call in if you, if you have any questions or any changes in symptoms. Definitely let us know. But I do expect, you know, just we'll check the two rapid tests for the flu and COVID or either the Zyrtec over the counter or prescription and then that that should probably help you and we'll go from there. Okay. That sounds good. Okay. Alright, thanks Briar Hayfield."

I was trying to open sort of a gate.  into the furnace so I could insert and I use a screwdriver and accidentally try pry something open and I stab myself with...  Sort of not so clean screwdriver. Gotcha. In your left forearm area? Yes. when did this happen? Last night. Okay, about what time? 8pm. So 8pm yesterday this happened? Yeah. And did it bleed a lot? Yeah, it was bleeding and I...  Use some alcohol to clean it up. It's kind of deep. My wife told me to come in, maybe a tetanus shot. I don't think I've gotten a tetanus shot in years.  or decades. You think it's been greater than five years ago that you had a Tetris? Yeah, greater than five years. Okay. And did you notice any redness around the wound or discharge or anything like that?

So we'll give you a tetanus booster shot. I'm going to have the medical assistant come in and irrigate it really good. And we'll put an in a bandage. And I want you to wash it two times a day. Put topical antibiotic ointment on it. And if it's not getting better in the next five to seven days, let us know. We do want you to watch for infection. So if you notice redness around it.  Pause streaking redness up your arm. Those would be bad signs. You'd want to come back for right away Thank you doc. I don't think you need oral for this. Okay? Thank goodness."
