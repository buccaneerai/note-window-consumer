#### INTRO

#### CC
Grade: 10
Differences: None

#### HPI
Grade: 8
Differences: The AI-generated note does not mention the cough being evenly distributed on both sides, the patient's throat gunk, and the patient denying sore throat, chest pain, and headache. It also refers to the inhaler as "Flowvent" instead of not specifying the inhaler's name.

#### ROS

#### Assessment & Plan
