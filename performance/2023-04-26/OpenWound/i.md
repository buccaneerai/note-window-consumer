The patient accidentally stabbed themselves in the left arm with a not-so-clean screwdriver while trying to change the air filter in their furnace. The incident occurred last night at around 8pm. The wound bled a lot, and the patient used alcohol to clean it up. The patient's wife suggested they come in for a possible tetanus shot, as they haven't had one in years or even decades. The patient applied Neosporin and a bandaid on the wound, and fortunately, they have not experienced any numbness or tingling in their hand.
