Hi August Clancy, how are you doing today? Not so good, doctor. Actually, we're starting a new system here. Would you mind just telling me your first and last name, please? Yeah, Aspen Fieldscout. Alright, and can you also just confirm your date of birth, please? August 18, 1988. Okay, thanks for that. So, tell me, what's going on? Well, I've had a cough for about two weeks now and I just can't seem to get rid of it. Did it start two weeks ago? Well, it kind of started about three weeks ago. Okay. But it's been really bad for the last two weeks. Okay, and over the last two weeks, has it been about the same? Is it getting better, getting worse from the beginning to now? I'd say it's been about the same. It's been about the same. And when it started three weeks ago, was there anything going on that might have started the cough for you? Well, yeah, I started with cold. I had all kinds of gunk in my throat and it was causing me to cough. Okay. But I feel like I got over the cold, but the cough just hasn't gone away. So, what were the other cold symptoms that you had when it started three weeks ago? Well, I had a bit of a fever and a lot of nasal congestion. I felt like my senses were kind of really clogged up. Okay. And so those symptoms have all subsided, but you still have the cough. Is that right? Yeah, I've just been coughing, but it hasn't really been productive. Like I'm not coughing anything up. Okay. So, just a dry cough then? Yeah, just a dry cough. Okay. And over the last few weeks, you said it's been about the same. So, about like, you know, how often are you coughing in a given day? No, it seems to come and go. It seems to be worse when I exercise or like if I'm outside, cold air. Okay. So, cold air makes it worse or more frequent. Exercise makes it worse or more frequent. Is that right? Yeah. I should mention my other doctor thought that I might have asthma. Okay. And have you ever been diagnosed or treated for asthma? I'm not sure if I was officially diagnosed, but they did give me an inhaler. I think it was a flow vent or something like that. Okay. And when's the last time you used that for any asthma-like symptoms? Oh, I haven't used it in months. Okay. So, you haven't done it in the last few weeks or last two or three weeks when you had this cough recently? No. I don't have a prescription for it anymore. Okay. And you don't have any in your home. You don't have any of the inhalers left? No. Okay. That's fine. That could be an option. Tell me if you have any other, you know, associated symptoms with the coughing. Not the cold symptoms, but like in the last week or two, since the cold symptoms mostly subsided, you had any other symptoms associated with the cough? Yeah. Sometimes I feel like a little bit wheezing, and my chest just feels kind of like tight, like inflamed. Okay. Is it painful in your chest? Not painful, just like a little bit of discomfort, I would say. Okay. Can you tell if it's one side of the chest or the other or kind of throughout? I think it's just throughout. Okay. So it's not left or right, just kind of throughout? Yeah. I'd say it's pretty evenly. Okay. Are you having any headaches at all? No. I don't recall having any headaches recently. Any changes in your vision? No. No changes. No blurry vision, double vision, anything like that? No. Nothing like that. And you said before during the cold, three weeks ago, the kind of the nasal congestion, runny nose, and anything like that in the last one or two days or last week? I have noticed a little bit of drip on the back of my throat. Okay. And then any sore throat at all? Again, not the cold part of it, but in the last few days or last week? No, no sore throat. Okay. All right. Any difficulty breathing or shortness of breath? Sometimes I feel a little bit short of breath, especially if I'm exercising or moving around. Okay. And does it feel like you're drowning when you're underwater and you just can't breathe? There's almost like water in your lungs? No. No. Okay. How about any nausea or vomiting? One time I did cough so hard that I vomited a little bit. Okay. But right after the cough? Yeah. Okay. Any nausea otherwise or vomiting otherwise when it's not like right after the cough? No. Okay. What about constipation, diarrhea? No. I haven't noticed anything like that. Okay. Any pain anywhere else in your body, arms, legs, back? No, I don't think so. Okay. And then any changes in sensation like touching things with your hands or kind of feeling the ground on your feet, anything like that? No. No. Okay. All right. So I think what I'd like to do is take a look at your throat and your nose and see if there's anything abnormal that I can see. And then we'll do just a rapid flu test and a rapid COVID test just to rule those out, make sure that there's nothing residual going on from that. But most likely, this sounds like maybe related to a history of asthma or asthma-like condition or maybe even allergies and then a residual cough that sometimes occurs after upper respiratory infection like a cold. And so most likely it is residual cough post URI is what we would call it. And we can try a couple things. I do want to do those lab tests like I mentioned. I'll get you a prescription for Tessalon pearls, which could be helpful reducing the cough. But at first, and then I can also put down just a few over-the-counter medications that might be helpful, like a robotessa or a generic of a robotessa that has dextromethorphan. That'll be a cough suppressant that could help you out as well. And then, you know, I'd suggest we try these for maybe like a week or two, see how it goes. And I think just naturally it will probably recover from this residual cough, just symptomatically like the Tessalon pearls and the cough syrup with the dextromethorphan should help. Okay. Great. Well, thank you, doctor. I really appreciate the help. All right. Thanks for coming in. I think you'll be back to normal soon. Thanks, doctor Briar Hayfield All right.
