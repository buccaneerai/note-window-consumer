Good morning, Mr. [NAME]. How are you doing today? Not so well. I stabbed myself accidentally trying to...  changed the air filter in my furnace. Mmm, sorry to hear that. Yeah. So where did you stab yourself? Right here on the arm. Okay, so you stabbed yourself in your left arm? Yeah, on my left arm. I was trying to open sort of a gate.  into the furnace so I could insert and I use a screwdriver and accidentally try pry something open and I stab myself with...  Sort of not so clean screwdriver. Gotcha. In your left forearm area? Yes. when did this happen? Last night. Okay, about what time? 8pm. So 8pm yesterday this happened? Yeah. And did it bleed a lot? Yeah, it was bleeding and I...  Use some alcohol to clean it up. It's kind of deep. My wife told me to come in, maybe a tetanus shot. I don't think I've gotten a tetanus shot in years.  or decades. You think it's been greater than five years ago that you had a Tetris? Yeah, greater than five years. Okay. And did you notice any redness around the wound or discharge or anything like that? No discharge. What I did was I just got some Neosporin and put a bandaid over it.  Are you having any numbness or tingling to your hand? Fortunately not. Okay. No. Any to your hand? No. Okay. Any fevers or chills? Nice.  yet. Nausea or vomiting? Any streaking redness like up towards your shoulder or upper arm? Nope. And do you have a past medical history of diabetes?  No smoke cigarettes. Nope. All right. Well, let me examine your forearm here and see.  Please take a look. I'm just scared. It looks... Okay, it looks rather minor. I think I might as well just maybe whim. But...  But no, I'm just joking, Mr. [NAME]. So I think that you do not need stitches. I do think we should update your today.  So we'll give you a tetanus booster shot. I'm going to have the medical assistant come in and irrigate it really good. And we'll put an in a bandage. And I want you to wash it two times a day. Put topical antibiotic ointment on it. And if it's not getting better in the next five to seven days, let us know. We do want you to watch for infection. So if you notice redness around it.  Pause streaking redness up your arm. Those would be bad signs. You'd want to come back for right away Thank you doc. I don't think you need oral for this. Okay? Thank goodness.
