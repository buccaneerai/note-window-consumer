Hi Brian. How are you doing today? I’m doing fine, Dr. Mollon. I followed up with the cardiologist like you recommended. Thanks Brian. I’m glad to hear that. Last time you were here about six weeks ago, we talked about the heart rates you saw on your smart watch going up to 200. I’m glad that you were able to see the cardiologist as I recommended. I received the evaluation from cardiology, which ordered the 24 hour Holter monitor and I saw that that study was completed. Thanks for going through all of that. Hopefully it was relatively straightforward and not any problem for you. I don’t know if the cardiologist talked to you about the results, but there were no abnormal readings. Both the cardiologist and I agree that we do not need any additional workup or testing or evaluation for the heart rates you saw in your smart watch. If you do have any symptoms that accompany the heart rates that are high on the smart watch, definitely let me know right away. Otherwise, we can continue to monitor as needed. Thanks, doc. The cardiologist told me the same story and I’m glad that all of this is resolved. I do like the smart watch and use it routinely for exercise and walking and everything, so I’ll continue to do that and I’ll let you know if I have any symptoms or anything and if I see any patterns with the smart watch and the heart rate, I can let you know. But I’m glad everything turned out okay with the testing. That’s great. Do you have any other questions about the heart rate or the smart watch or the Holter monitor testing? No, everything seems fine. I understand everything and appreciate your help with going through the questions I had. No problem Brian. Glad to help out and glad to see that all of the study results are negative and we don’t really need to do anything further. That sounds great to me. We also talked about your hemoglobin last time and over the last six months looked like there was a gradual decrease in the hemoglobin. That may have been a pattern, so I did recommend that colonoscopy. Just wanna make sure that there’s no blood loss occurring in the gastrointestinal tract. Dr. Mollon. I have not had a chance to see the gastroenterologist yet, but I will definitely talk to my son who’s a doctor and decide if you know I wanna see the gastroenterologist and the colonoscopy and where the best place is to go and everything. That’ll be fine. I recommend the colonoscopy, so please let your son know that he can talk to me if he has any questions or would like to discuss your case. Yeah, I’ll do that. Okay, thanks. Otherwise, don’t really need to do anything further with the hemoglobin. We’ll keep on monitoring every three months with blood tests. Thanks. That sounds good. We’re continuing you on the two medications, the Metformin for the pre-diabetes and the Atorvastatin for your cholesterol. Just to review, I saw that you did have the past surgical history of the inguinal repairs and nothing to do there and just wanted to see how you’re doing at home. Yeah, I’m enjoying retirement with my wife and in our house. My son does live nearby. I see him often. He’s a doctor, so I always ask him questions as you know and make sure that everything is good with him. Still not drinking, no alcohol, no smoking, don’t do any other drugs. Great. I just wanted to run through a few other questions to make sure there’s nothing else going on. Sure, that sounds fine. Are you having any headaches or eye symptoms or hearing symptoms? No, nothing at all. Do you have any difficulty breathing or wheezing? No. Are you having any chest pain? Feeling like your heart’s jump or having pain in your legs while walking? No. Do you have any nausea or vomiting, constipation or diarrhea? No, nothing like that. Here’s what we’ll do. We’ll have you continue your metformin for the pre-diabetes. Continue to check the fasting blood sugar every three months. Also, continue the atorvastatin for your cholesterol. In terms of the cardiology evaluation, there’s nothing else to do right now. We’ll just have you follow up with the cardiologist as he recommended once a year. Definitely let me know if there are any symptoms or other concerns with the heart rate or the smart watch in terms of the hemoglobin. Did want you to consider that colonoscopy. Just lemme know if you have any questions and then in terms of following up with me, we’ll just continue every three months. Please get the blood tests for your blood count, the hemoglobin, as well as the lipids, the cholesterol, and your fasting glucose every three months and then we will follow up as needed. Thanks so much for everything, doc. I appreciate your help and I will see you next time. Thanks so much, Brian. Take care.
