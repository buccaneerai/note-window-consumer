Hi. Hi, my name is Aspen Fieldscout. I'm Dr. Briar Hayfield. How can I help you? I've got this crazy bad headache. Okay, can you tell me a little bit more about it? Well, it just woke up with me and it's been like this since about five. And it's just been like terrible since. Okay, where does it hurt? Right here. Sorry. Were you feeling fine when you went to bed last night? Well, I sort of felt actually kind of feverish. My son has actually been sick for a couple of days and I thought, I said to my wife, I think I'm getting what, what Liam's got. And so I sort of felt like I'm getting sick, like maybe nauseated, but that is that that's it. Okay, with this headache, are you having any other symptoms? Like are you getting blurred vision or anything like that or numbness or weakness? No, but I, the only thing is like the pain was just so bad. I was just throwing up with the pain. It was crazy like it still is. It's just so bad, right? You look pretty uncomfortable. I'm going to get my nurse to put in an IV and give you something for the pain. Is that okay? Okay. Heavy grace. Okay. A little bit more about this headache. Did you ever get headaches? Do you have problems with headaches? No, no. Do you have any other medical problems? I've got some asthma and oh, I got, I've got like some car sickness, but I've been told once before that's like, there's a large history of family of migraines in my family that might be connected. My asthma has been pretty bad, pretty stable. Do you take any medications? Yeah, I'm on an orange puffer. I take all the time. I think it's flow vent or float is seen or something like that. I've got the blue puffer, but I almost never have to take it. Do you have any allergies? No, not at all. Okay. Now tell me about your kids a bit sick right now, but you woke up with a sudden onset of a headache. Is that correct? Yeah, I woke up and it was just there. It's, it's, it woke me up. It's just crazy. It's just the worst pain I've ever had. Oh yeah. Did you try anything for that pain? Yeah, I took some Tylenol. I had a couple extra strength tablets and that made no difference. Okay. Few other questions. Have you had any rash, diarrhea, swollen joints or anything else? No, but my son had a bit of a rash there, right? But I'm sure. Have you recently traveled outside of the country? No. Okay. So we're going to get you something for the pain and I'll need to examine you. Okay. I'm going to a brief physical exam. Is that okay? Okay. Okay. Great. First off, I'm just going to feel your neck. Okay. And now let's have you lay down and lay still. Does that hurt? It does. Where exactly does it hurt? All over. Okay. That morphine is going to come fairly shortly. Okay. Okay. All right. I'm going to lift your legs and just tell me if this hurts at all. Does it hurt in your leg or neck or anything like that? A little bit now. Does this hurt at all? Not really. Okay. I have to look at a couple of other things. I'm going to examine your eyes. Is the light bothering your eyes at all? No, not really. Okay. Just look straight up at the ceiling for me. Does that bother your eyes at all? Not really. Okay. Have you ever had morphine before? No. All right. We're also going to give you something for that nausea as well. Okay. Okay. Are you feeling sick to your stomach at all right now? A little bit. I think it's just the pain. Okay. I got to look at a couple of nerves. Okay. Okay. It might be easier for you to sit up. Can you sit up for me? Sure. Are you going to be okay? Yeah, I think. All right. Just follow my fingers with your eyes. Okay. Now clench your teeth real tight for me. Good. Now close your eyes real tight. Good. Now show me your teeth. Good. Can you wrinkle up your forehead or look at the ceiling? Great. Can you hear this at all? Can you hear it on the side? Yeah. What about this side? Yeah. Open your mouth for me and say, ah. Ah. Push your head against my hand. That's really sore. Okay. Well, we'll leave that for now. Can you shrug your shoulders? Okay. Good. Can you stick your tongue out at me? Good. I'm just about done examining you, but I have to do a few other things. We're going to check your reflexes. Have you ever had that done before? Years ago. All right. Well, let's just see if you have good reflexes. Okay. All right. This one, you've got good reflexes. That's a good sign. That's good. Okay. Just relax. Push your arms up like this for me. Keep them down. Good. Now push against my hands. Good. Now relax your arms. Okay. Okay. Don't let me turn this one and don't let me turn this other one. Okay. Give me the biceps here. Good. Now this one. Good. Now put your fingers out like this. Good. Now squeeze my fingers. Great. Now push against my hand. Good. Now push against this hand. Okay. Just relax. Great. Sorry to push you through that. Just lay down and try and get comfortable and we'll get you a blanket. So I'm a little bit worried about you. I'm worried about a couple of things. Okay. I'm worried about the chance of you having meningitis. Okay. Now this is a bit of a scary term. You also tell me this is the worst headache of your life. Oh yeah. So there's a small chance there's something else going on, like a small bleed in your brain. So those are both very scary, potentially dangerous things. Okay. So we're going to give you something for the pain and we're going to send you off for a CAT scan of your brain to make sure there's no blood or anything else in there. Okay. If that's normal, I will have to do a lumbar puncture. I have to take some fluid from your spine. Okay. Whatever. Okay.
