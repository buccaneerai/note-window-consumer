Hi, how's it going? Good. How are you doing? Doctor? I'm doing fine. Thanks for coming in today. So, can you just tell me your full name and date of birth for the record, please? Yeah, Briar Hayfield, April 20th, Okay. And what brings you in today? , well, I've been having a really stuffy nose and a lot of, like, post nasal drip. How long has this been going on for? It's been going on for a couple of weeks now? Okay. And is this something new for you? These kind of symptoms? , no, I've had this before, usually happens around, like, springtime sometimes in all. And so over the last few weeks, has it, has it gotten worse? Better stay the same fluctuates how the symptoms been? . I think it's getting worse. Okay. It's been so over the course of a few weeks it's kind of getting worse every day. Or how would you describe that? I'd say gradually getting worse, but probably worse some days than others. Okay. And, any, sick contacts, anyone with like, cold or flu or COVID in the home or at work? No, I don't think so. And when, when you experience the symptoms, does it feel like, you know, when, when you've had, like, allergy symptoms in the past or can you differentiate it all? Sometimes people kind of feel different when they're, you know, sick with flu versus, like, sick with, with allergies. , I don't know, I haven't really noticed a fever or anything like that, so I think maybe it's more allergies and what about, like, time outside or around areas that, you know, you might get allergies from? Yeah, it does seem to be worse if I spend time outdoors. Okay. All right. And is that kind of how, it used to be, like in the past when you've had these kinds of symptoms? Yeah, it seems consistent. Yeah. So, usually, like, outdoor time around this time of year you get these types of symptoms even though when there's no one, like, you know, kind of stick around you. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I mean, I think, like you're suggesting it does sound more like a allergy kind of symptom than, than, something related to, like, upper respiratory infection from, like, a flu or a cold or COVID. And so, have you ever tried anything, any allergy medications to help you with these? , yeah, I've tried Benadryl. That seems to help but it makes me really sleepy. I've tried Claritin and I didn't really find that helped very much. And so have you tried these over the last few weeks or something you just tried in the past? . Yeah, I tried taking Benadryl and that seemed to help when I was taking it. And what what time of day did you try if any specific time of day? Oh, I usually take it before I go to bed at night and in the morning. Okay. Alright. And do you know how many tablets you took? Just one? I think one? Okay and so and they typically come in 25 mg tablets so you just got it from the pharmacy over the counter, right? Yeah. Yeah. so yeah so it sounds like that they haven't really helped too much in the past but but maybe somewhat. Is that fair? Yeah I think they help a little bit little bit. Okay. Is there a couple options in terms of over the counter versus prescription? So we can we can talk about those which which may be helpful for you. So tell me a little bit more about you know the symptoms or anything else you're feeling when you have these symptoms that have been getting worse these past few weeks. I have a little bit of a cough as well so stuffy nose cough. Are you spitting up anything any mucus or flame? Yeah sometimes I cough up like green gunky stuff. Okay. Alright and that's been happening for a few weeks that kinda once in a while. , yeah, it's been especially bad the last couple of weeks and then any difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, a company of that. , no, not really any wheezing sounds when you're breathing. No, no wheezing. Okay. And then what about any, any chest pain or, you know, feeling like your heart is racing? No, nothing like that. I have had a little bit of a sore throat at times two. Okay. But nausea, vomiting. Do you ever feel nauseous with the symptoms? No, no. no vomiting, constipation, diarrhea. No, nothing like that. And then he said no fever. what about like feeling chills or anything like that? No, no. any kind of muscle pain, joint pain soreness. No, I haven't noticed anything like that either. How about like feeling tired, malaise that kind of stuff? Yeah, I have felt a little tired. Okay. Alright. Yeah, that can happen with, with electric symptoms certainly. And then, any other medical issues, any past medical, conditions that, that we haven't talked about or that we've talked about before. No, not that I know. No. Okay. no, diabetes, cholesterol issues. , hypertension, high blood pressure. Okay. Yeah, I think we've done the screening free before, so I haven't picked up on any of those. I just wanted to double check and then in terms of, you know, conditions or diseases that run in the family. any any allergies you know and and your family members, siblings, parents, Children. Yeah, my dad has really bad allergies too but asthma, any family history of asthma, not that I know of. No. Okay. Alright. And then any other conditions that run in the family heart disease, diabetes, lung disease. yeah, my grandmother was diabetic. Okay. All right in terms of your parents, siblings, Children anyone with diabetes? No. Okay. Alright. And then, I think what we'll do is just based on kind of the timing and the symptoms, I think it's worth just quickly checking a rapid test for both flu and, and for COVID. just to rule those out, the tests aren't perfect but if you get a negative on, on both of those, it's much less likely to be any those those two and then, I think, I would like you to try a few different, allergy medications. So I mean if you've done the Benadryl or Claritin, Zyrtec is one that's over the counter saturation is the generic Zyrtec is a brand name us and over the counter medication I would suggest, you know, you can do 10 mg, nightly of that and you know, give it a week and you know, she probably benefit within a day or two, but I would give that a week trial and then we can also do prescription of that. if you have a preference in terms of, kind of like your out of pocket pay. We can, we can start with the prescription of the 10 mg, Zyrtec or if you want to do it over the counter, we can do that. You can let me know and we'll set you up either way and then, I think that's it for now. we'll follow up, you can call in if you, if you have any questions or any changes in symptoms. Definitely let us know. But I do expect, you know, just we'll check the two rapid tests for the flu and COVID or either the Zyrtec over the counter or prescription and then that that should probably help you and we'll go from there. Okay. That sounds good. Okay. Alright, thanks Briar Hayfield.
