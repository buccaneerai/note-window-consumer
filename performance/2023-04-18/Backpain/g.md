All right, so can you tell me your first and last name please?  Brook Canterburry. Okay, great. Can you also just confirm your date of birth please? June 3rd, 1989. Okay, great. And so what brings you in today? Yeah, so about, I mean, I've kind of always had back problems, but maybe about two years ago, I started noticing that when I'm sitting down for long periods of time, I've been getting these kind of pains down my left leg, sort of, you know, pit scadles, sort of cold. And I do notice that it seems to be when I'm sitting on like harder surfaces, like hard, like chair, like wood chair, that kind of stuff. It seems to somewhat get better when I exercise. So like when I stretch or do yoga, it seems like it does better. But if I don't do that for a while, it seems to act up. Okay, and you said it started about two years ago? Yeah, I mean, I sort of had some back problems like this, you know, since I was a teenager. But, you know, two years ago, I started going to the gym. I didn't really go to the gym growing up for, you know, younger adult years. But then I started going and one seems to be related to, you know, after I started actually moving again, that it seems to be getting worse. Okay, and you said you were describing on your left leg where you feel that kind of pins and needles and that coldness. Now, are there symptoms in the back itself and the leg, or is it really just the leg where you feel those things? It seems like all of my problems, I forgot what it's called, but that little bone on the back where your hip is, it kind of like sticks out a little bit. It seems like my, you know, QL, my TFL, even my psoas, like all these muscles are just constantly really tight on the left side of my body only, not on the right side. I have had a chiropractor and I had an x-ray before of my lower back. And I was told I'm not a little fuzzy on these, but like L5 or L4, one of the vertebrae is like fused a bit on my left hand side to my hip. And I think that causes some issues like inbound. Yeah, yeah, it's like fused on the left hand side. So my right hand side is always perfectly fine. My left hand side, the muscles are always super tight, like the erector, spinae muscles, and glute muscles, all that kind of stuff. I don't know if it's, they're all locked up and they need to relax somehow but can't or whatever. Yeah, and so around two years ago, that coincided when you started going to the gym and doing more activity. And then that's when you kind of noticed this come on more. And like over the last two years, would you say it's kind of progressively gotten worse, gotten better, about the same, kind of up and down, but never really consistently could get worse? How would you describe it? Yeah, I would say it's getting worse. It's getting worse, okay. Yeah, yeah. So I did the x-ray about six months ago. I was seeing a chiropractor at the time. She suggested I put a lift in my shoe. I tried that for a while. I don't know if that made it better or worse. But yeah, I just, it's at the point now where it kind of keeps me from doing things that I enjoy. It's kind of always, you know, I also look back, I think, sitting down for a long period of time is hard. So I tried to do one. Go ahead. Sorry, go ahead. You're going to say it's interfering with things you enjoy. What are the kinds of physical activities that it's interfering with that you would enjoy? So one, it doesn't ever seem to act up when I'm doing the physical activities, but if it is in an acted up state from being sitting down for too long, it pretty much consumes my mental, you know, like this constant pain and discomfort that kind of detracts from the overall enjoyment of anything else. I see. So it's not during, you know, whatever enjoyable activities that you have that happen. It's just, it's kind of like a baseline when you're sitting too long that prevents you or precludes you from doing the other stuff. Is that right? Right. I do, I will say using like a ball, like a, you know, like a lacrosse ball and kind of putting pressure on various things like my QL or in the blue does seem to provide some relief. But I'm not sure if it just provides temporary relief and causes it to get worse, like causes it to be more inflamed or more aggravated, or if it actually does provide kind of longer term benefits. Sure. And you mentioned the chiropractor, you know, no issue with the lift. Were there any manipulations, spinal manipulations that were done? Tell me a little bit about that. Yeah, I don't know the names of all of them, but a lot of it is, you know, lay down, face down on the table, lift my legs. If I feel any discomfort, you'll, you know, kind of push slightly, kind of near where the hip is or the lower back. Kind of some of those things. She'll have my arm out and then have me like try and resist pressure and then while she's feeling up my curbreeze, try and see if they're out of alignment. She doesn't have to do alignment. I've been seeing this particular chiropractor for like 10 years. Okay. Okay. It sounds like relatively small manipulations, not kind of like a back-cracking kind of manipulation. Okay. All right. No. Okay. And then other than kind of sort of like using a hard lacrosse ball and kind of pressing it, anything else that makes it better, like, you know, like massage or it can over the counter as a tylenol or ibuprofen or anything else that helps it? Yeah, I think non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs do seem to help. I think ice makes the sensation go away quite a bit. I think it's not as much a cold does seem to make it feel better. I mean, really, stretching does make it feel better at the time. So I don't know. But again, I guess I'm still a little unsure. I'm trying to figure out if I'm making it worse by doing those things. I just need to leave it alone and let it just relax somehow. But at the same time, I feel like if I'm not stretching the muscles, then they're not going to relax. They're not going to get better. Okay. And then in terms of at the gym, what kind of workout are you doing? What kind of like are you using machines, weights, cardio, like what kind of your typical workout or if there's not a typical like what are the things that you generally do? When I first started going to the gym, I was doing a lot of cardio. I was doing one of those heart rate based interval training systems. There was a lot of running or rowing, a lot of calisthenics, that kind of thing. Nowadays, I'm doing more just like weight training type stuff. I do use some machines like linear leg press, hip abduction, hip abduction. I'm trying to work those muscles, like those side glute muscles. And when I first started doing that, I did notice that there was a huge discrepancy with the abduction and the adduction with how much of weight I could do. Adduction was just squeezing it in. I could only do like 40 pounds or something on the machine. And over the last couple of years, I'm all the way up to like 150 pounds now. So like pretty marked in the strength of those like leg muscles. Yeah. But yeah, I think I am coming around the idea that maybe there's something about that. And with my lower vertebrae, that's like causing like a pinched nerve or something. I guess that's my concern. Yeah. And some of the symptoms that you mentioned in your leg that sounds nerve-related. So it could be. Now, on like a daily basis or a weekly basis, how often is this bothering you? It's almost daily at this point. Almost so. I would say if I sit down for longer than 10 minutes, I will start to have those sensations. And this is kind of a weird. This is kind of a weird. This is kind of a weird. And if I sit down for too long, I end up with prostatitis. Right? So the inflammation of the prostate. So it really is something to do. To me, it's 100%. There's something mechanical. Right? There's like, it's like I do a lot of Googling. So, you know, WebMD, figure out what's wrong. But like people who ride bikes a lot. It's going to happen too. And so I don't know if there's like some treatment for this or if there's some diagnostic we can do to kind of rule out what the problem is or see if it's nerve-related or see if it's, you know, see what the issue is. Yeah. I mean, I think you're right that there's some nerve involvement because sometimes on your leg, your left leg. And then, you know, I also agree that there's some kind of physical mechanical component to it. So we can certainly explore both of those. Now, have you tried any physical therapy at all? I have done physical therapy. I did 10 sessions. They weren't specifically a hip clinic, right? They weren't specifically a hip place. But they did various things. They, you know, did like deep myofascial release and kind of deep tissue type stuff around my psoas muscle and stuff like that. They even did some dry needling, which I thought was kind of interesting, you know, where they put the needle and then shock it, shock your muscle a little bit. Again, it didn't really seem to help at all. And I did 10 sessions over the course of a month and a half, two months, something like that. And I didn't notice any change. And this was a physical therapist, a PT that was working with you? Yes. Was there any occupational therapists involved? I don't think so. I don't know how I would differentiate. Yeah, there's slightly different skill sets and training, but certainly overlap. And then have you, have you sit a lot for, you know, work or kind of daily activities? Is that something that's typical for you? Yeah. I'm a software engineer, so I spend most of my day sitting down. I do have the option for a standing desk. My desk does convert. But I think standing in the same place kind of does yield the same, what was the same issue. I'll tend to shift my weight to one side or the other. And I think doing that, I can also aggravate it as well. But sitting does seem to be the primary trigger. And are you sitting a lot outside of work time as well? Laying down mostly on the couch. I'm kind of trying to look at the bottom of the box. In the lane, do you have that same problem? Not really. It depends on how I'm, I mean, there are some positions that I'm laying down and the couch is not comfortable yet. But I've kind of figured a way to sit down on the couch where it doesn't bother me. Okay. And just in terms of the pain level, like zero being no pain, ten being the worst, you know, where is it? You're saying most days you have the pain. Like what's the range of that on a given day? On a given day, it's normally between a two and a five. But it can kind of snowball. Like sitting a lot for one day, the next day maybe it will be like an eight. And then when you use, you mentioned NSAIDs help you and like holding the cross ball or hardball pressure there helps. Like what is it, how much does it help in terms like the numbers? When I'm actively pushing, for example, into my QL, I basically don't feel the pain. I only feel the sensation from pushing in the QL. It's so pitiful, but it's a good kind of pain. Does that make sense? Like it's like a rubber of some kind. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And would you say like, you know, if it's like two to five, it brings it pretty much down to zero? Yeah. And then when I'm not doing it again, it'll come back. It'll come back where it was. Okay. And then what about NSAIDs when you're using that? How much does it come down? 30% of whatever it is. Okay. And is it typically one type? Like do you use an ibuprofen slash Advil or is it a different one? Is it Advil or Aleve? Naproxen? Yeah, naproxen is Aleve. So that's a different one than the ibuprofen and advil. So is that typically what you use in a procsen? Yeah. Okay. All right. And do you know, you know, how much you would take to get that, you know, 30% release? I think it's 500 milligrams twice a day. Okay. So you take it, you know, multiple days in a row or do you kind of just take it as needed when the pain is higher? I think it's generally kind of as needed, but I think, you know, yeah. And my only concern with that is just that long term. I know that it's not great for your kidneys or something. So I was kind of taking it as needed. But, you know, from what I did consult with a pharmacist, it's okay to take daily for a few weeks or however long to try and wrangle it in. Yeah, I mean, yeah, that's generally correct. You're right about the kidney issue, but it depends on other factors as well. And so maybe you can tell me about just, and August Clancy, if you want to make some of this fictitious, so can you tell me a little bit about, you know, any medical conditions that you have in general? I don't have any other medical conditions as far as I know. No issues with heart, high blood pressure, diabetes, high blood sugar, something like that. Anything else is pretty much 100% normal. I think just a long history of back problems from all the way from being a teenager and poor posture and being a computer lab. What are any injuries to that area that you're aware of? Like sports or accident, I think. There was, when I was a kid, I slid down a slide head first on my back. And at the bottom of the slide, there was some tree roots. And so I kind of hit the tree roots with my vertebrae. And then I was only like nine. I ended up riding my bike home, which I know is not a great idea after a back injury. Now, now. We went to the hospital, they checked everything out. They said everything was mostly okay, but they said there was some bruising around the vertebrae and stuff. But they ended up sending me home. I wasn't committed to the hospital at all. That's really the only people in the room, x-rays, those kinds of work out. Yeah, right, yeah. When I did do the x-ray for my lower vertebrae there to take a look, they said it's not really possible for them to know if it was due to an injury or if I was just kind of born that way or if it just kind of, you know, so maybe I've always been like this. And, well, maybe that's why I always had back problems on my left side. Because, I mean, my back problems have always been on my left side, even as far back as I can remember. Just in the last two years, it seems to have taken a much different, that's the word, the symptoms have been very different, more acute, more, you know, worse. So any other medications that you take besides the naproxen? Just allergy medication. Aspen Fieldscout, and what do you use for that? Citrazine. Citrazine. And is that the one just over the counter that you use? I do have a prescription for it just because it's cheaper to get a prescription. But, yeah, I think it's just the same as my brand name is. Yeah, and is it like a 10 milligram tab? Yeah, 10 milligram. And you take that daily throughout the year or just during certain times of the year? Summer and fall, I usually don't take it in the wintertime. All right, and then any history of surgeries at all? I've had them. All right, and what about conditions that run in your family, particularly mother, father, or siblings? My mother is very sick. She's always been sick ever since I was a kid. I remember all of them, exactly, but like Briar Hayfield's and fibromyalgia, she also has tons of back problems. She just has back surgery. She's always sick. She's always been sick. So, yeah, maybe there is a genetic component, I'm not sure. And Crohn's. Can you have fibromyalgia Briar Hayfield's for that? Yeah, she's diagnosed, as far as I know, Briar Hayfield's, fibromyalgia, interstitial cystitis. Okay. All kinds of things. And then what about your father or siblings? He is healthy, as far as I know, nothing. My brother had his gallbladder removed, but otherwise healthy. I think that's it, yeah. Okay, and how old are your parents? My dad is 61, and my mom is 58. Okay, and how old are your parents? 58. Okay, and you said you have a brother, any other siblings? I have one full brother, and then three half-siblings. Okay, and then the full brother, how old is he? He's two, though, and me, he is, oh my gosh, 36. 36, okay. All right, and then the half-siblings are those, so you share father or father? Father. Okay. Yep, sure. And how old are they? 26, 24, and 18. Okay, and no medical conditions that you know? I don't think they have any, as far as I know. Anyone else in your family, like on your mom's side, have Crohn's or ulcerative colitis, or any issue with colon? As far as I know, it's just my mother. Just your mother, okay, all right. And did you develop that when I was about two years old? Where to, okay, and do you have an idea of how severe the Crohn's is for your mother? Did she require hospitalizations and surgery, and as she had like colon parts removed? She actually has never had any of it removed, as far as I know. Has she required hospitalizations for the Crohn's, specifically? Many times, yeah. Thank you, all right. And, okay, and so you told me that you're an engineer. Do you use any, or how often do you usually drink, and what do you drink in terms of alcohol? Maybe like once a week, maybe have one or two. Okay. Beer, not hard liquor, beer. One or two, usually beer, once a few times a week, okay. And then maybe twice a week during football. Okay, good. And so what about tobacco use, smoking? Not any tobacco at all, okay. And then any other drug use? No, okay. Good. So then anything else, so you know, we covered your low back issue and kind of your left leg, any other kind of symptoms or things that are bothering today or that typically bother you. And we talked about allergies too, but anything else? It's just that lower left back and left leg, that's pretty much it. Okay. Anything else? All right, and so like in terms of your arms, you know, both arms, no issues at all with those? Okay, all right. And what about like, you know, just partly because your mother has that condition of Crohn's, any problems with, you know, digestion or constipation, those kinds of things? I don't think so, not really. I could pretty much eat whatever I want. I don't really have any issues. Okay, all right. So at this point, if we're in person, probably do, you know, a basic physical exam, you know, focusing in on the area in the lower back and the legs and, you know, test your strength and things. But can't do that over the video chat. So I would, you know, the first thing I would recommend other than the in-person hands-on physical exam would be to reconsider, you know, the physical therapy and occupational therapy. So I think that, you know, you had the trial of physical therapy, and I think maybe adding an occupational therapist and then maybe having some ergonomics or an ergonomist kind of help you with your workstation. That might be helpful for you. I think, you know, they may not solve everything, but I think it can certainly help, particularly the ergonomist, depending on what you've done so far with your workstation, that can definitely add some benefit. And then, you know, the occupational therapist, you know, they're slightly different than a physical therapist, they'd be able to help you in kind of like general posture and things that you do at work, but, you know, also at home, even though they're occupational therapy. So I think, you know, a trial, another trial of PT slash OT and an ergonomist to help you with your workstation can be helpful. And in terms of imaging, I wouldn't suggest anything at the moment. You know, I think that first we want to just try some more conservative approaches. A lot of times you can pick up kind of incidental findings on imaging and chase after them, and that may not be the underlying issue. So we certainly will consider that, but not today. And then in terms of the NSAIDs, so it's good that the NAAP person is, the NAAP person is working for you. So there are a couple of other medications that I think we can try that may be helpful in the same class that are prescription strength. And so, you know, we can do a tortal to start, and that might be helpful. You can also do Tylenol or acetaminophen on a regular basis as opposed to as needed. Sometimes as needed doesn't work that well, but if you take it, what we call standing dose, like, you know, four times a day, 500 milligrams, something like that, that's something that's worth a try, like a trial of a few weeks of that to see if that is something that could work. And so I think I would start with that, with the 500 milligrams of acetaminophen four times a day and do that for two weeks, and then with the as needed, add the prescription tortal. I think that might be a good option for you. And so the thing is, we kind of talked a little bit about, like, heat and ice. So is that something that you've tried, like, a heat pad or, like, ice packs and kind of alternating those? Yeah, I haven't tried both. Okay. I would say ice seems to make it better than heat. He doesn't seem to do a whole lot, but ice seems to provide relief. Okay. So I think that's probably not much more to do there if you've used that. Now, have you tried any kind of patches or creams that kind of numb the area, prescription medicine? Nope, I haven't tried. A couple that might be helpful. There's one called a lidocaine patch, and then there's another one. So that's a patch that you apply, and you can do it, like, you know, 24 hours. So you think it'd be larger, so you cut that down and put it on. And there's also, like, a cream called a capsaicin cream that could be really helpful. And so have you tried that before? Like Badger Bowl? Was that a prescription or an over-the-counter? Was it over-the-counter? Over-the-counter, yeah. So there's the it might be similar, but, like, maybe, so that's another option. But I think in terms of, like, the order, I would start with the, you know, the PTOT evaluation, reevaluation, retraining with the air-conon amnest. We'll all do the prescription of Toradol for as needed. Try the acetaminophen 500 milligrams four times a day, and then add the Toradol as needed. And then we can  maybe next visit, we can see how that works out, and then we can consider, like, the patches or the creams as, you know, a second option. But, yeah, I think that's kind of where we'd start today. Any questions about anything? I don't think so. Yeah, I think looking online, I saw sometimes people recommend, you know, during times of, like, maybe muscle relaxers that target the pelvic muscles. Is that something that you think would be on the treatment plan or  Yeah, that could be an option. I think, you know, I would like to get the opinion of the occupational therapy and physical therapy first on that. You know, like we were talking about, there probably is some nerve involvement. There probably is, you know, some mechanical issue there. But I think sometimes with the right exercises and posture and kind of adjustments from PTOT, you may be able to address that without anything further. But, yeah, muscle relaxants are also an option. I think they may be a little more potent than some of the others I've mentioned. You know, that's certainly an option as well that we can look into.
