No, no. You talk to me like I'm a person, not like whatever you're talking like. OK. So you have this new type of headache. And the things it could be is it could be what we call a complex migraine, which is where you get a migraine and you can get associated.  busyness with it or more specifically something called a stibular migraine. It could be, too, you have a swaying or rocking. So it could be that you have something MAL, a day to bark event syndrome, that may be causing your headache. That's possible. And the third thing is it could be possibly you're having some allergies or things like that that are causing headache in addition to some of the swaying feelings. But I think at this point what we should do is get a CAT scan of your head in addition to CT angio. Thank you.  And then for now I think we can give you medication help. We can give you something called a specter of the vaccine to take every day to help with the swaying, feeling, and the headaches. And then over time it should help and then you can take as needed, I don't know, etcetera, for the headaches. What's the CT angio? CT angio is CAT scan of the blood vessels. It's looking for...  any narrowing or blockage or anything like that that could have caused your symptoms or any break in the blood vessels that can cause headache. And you effects or isn't that like antidepressant? It is, but it is also used for other things that's used for headaches that's used for like this kind of walking or swaying feeling that you're describing and the medication will start to get 37.5 milligrams a day and increase that as needed if the People both doesn't help. There are some side effects. It can cause insomnia sometimes  We can see eyesight effects, but the best time to keep it is in the so it wouldn't affect your sleep. Okay. And then, so I get those things, I get the meds that you're going to prescribe, and then what else? Anything else? We'll give you a script for the CAT scan and the CAT scan of the blood vessels for you to schedule that. There'll be the number on there. And then...  You'll follow up in one week. Follow up with? Follow up with me in one week in clinic. Okay, all right.
