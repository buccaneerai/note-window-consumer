#### HPI 
The patient has had back problems since their teenage years but noticed increased pain down their left leg when sitting on hard surfaces for the past two years. The pain seems to improve with exercise, stretching, and yoga but worsens if they don't engage in these activities for a while. The patient mentioned that their left side muscles are constantly tight, and they had an x-ray of their lower back, revealing that one of the vertebrae is fused on the left side. The patient tried physical therapy and chiropractic treatments, but they didn't provide lasting relief. They also tried using a lift in their shoe, but it didn't seem to make a significant difference.
