The patient accidentally stabbed themselves in the left arm with a not-so-clean screwdriver while trying to change the air filter in their furnace. The incident occurred last night at around 8pm. The wound bled quite a bit, and the patient used alcohol to clean it up. The patient's wife suggested they come in for a tetanus shot, as they have not had one in years, possibly decades. The patient applied Neosporin and a bandaid over the wound, and has not experienced any numbness, tingling, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, or streaking redness.
