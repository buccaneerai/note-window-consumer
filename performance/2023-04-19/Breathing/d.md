It just came back and it's been worse for the past couple of days. Okay. I’m glad you scheduled this follow up visit. We’ll get this figured out for you. Are you taking any medicines other than the steroids? I’ve been taking an albuterol inhaler when it gets really bad. Has it been getting gradually worse over the last a few days?
